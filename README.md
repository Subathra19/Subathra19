### On the Job
> **Network Analtics Engineer Engineer** @Eishaa Networks, Chennai.
>>**Low power design of Network on Chip** 
  >> * Implemented conventional Network on Chip (NoC) with XY routing algorithm using SimEvents and Simulink toolboxes in Simulink.
  >> * Designed and implemented NoC with a reduced number of routers.
  >> * Implemented RTM routing algorithm for single layer NoC in Matlab code editor and imported to Simulink using SimEvents toolbox.
  >> * Designed and implemented multi-layer NoC by creating a subsystem and using mask editor in Simulink.
  >> * A routing table was introduced to externally store and access the destination router address from the spreadsheet to reduce the number of computations.
  >> * A priority-based packet transmission was implemented using SimEvents and Simulink toolbox in Simulink.
  >> * Created different test case scenarios to test the model and estimate packet delivery ratio and packet drop.
  >> * A microstrip patch antenna was designed and its radio pattern is obtained for different frequencies using the antenna designer in MATLAB.
  >> * Zigbee model was introduced inside the enhanced NOC model using communication, SimEvents, and Simulink toolbox in Simulink. 

>>**LTE-A for military applications** 
  >> * Implemented an LTE single core network using INETv4.1.1 and LTE module in OMNET++.
  >> * Different test case scenarios such as a network with high mobile nodes, static nodes, dense network, and so on were created to check the network performance. 
  >> * Modiﬁed the existing eNB module by adding UE and EPC modules in OMNET++. 
  >> * An algorithm was introduced to switch the eNB nodes between different states (isolated, meshed, vUE) based on the mobility of nodes and availability of the core network.
  >> * Reviewed the model and ﬁxed the issues raised during the integration of the module.
