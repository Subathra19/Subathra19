### On the Job
> **Network Analtics Engineer Engineer** @Eishaa Networks, Chennai.
>>**Low power design of Network on Chip** 
  >> * Implemented conventional Network on Chip (NoC) with XY routing algorithm using SimEvents and Simulink toolboxes in Simulink.
  >> * Designed and implemented NoC with a reduced number of routers.
  >> * Implemented RTM routing algorithm for single layer NoC in Matlab code editor and imported to Simulink using SimEvents toolbox.
  >> * Designed and implemented multi-layer NoC by creating a subsystem and using mask editor in Simulink.
  >> * A routing table was introduced to externally store and access the destination router address from the spreadsheet to reduce the number of computations.
  >> * A priority-based packet transmission was implemented using SimEvents and Simulink toolbox in Simulink.
  >> * Created different test case scenarios to test the model and estimate packet delivery ratio and packet drop.
  >> * A microstrip patch antenna was designed and its radio pattern is obtained for different frequencies using the antenna designer in MATLAB.
  >> * Zigbee model was introduced inside the enhanced NOC model using communication, SimEvents, and Simulink toolbox in Simulink.
